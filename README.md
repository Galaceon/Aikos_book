Commissioned web project: a book review blog developed mainly with PHP, JavaScript, and SCSS, following an MVC architecture.

The platform includes user registration and authentication, email sending, and an admin dashboard. The main page displays book reviews written by the administrator, and users can access each individual review to read it in full, rate it with their own score, and leave comments.
